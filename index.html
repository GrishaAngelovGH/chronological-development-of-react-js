          <h3>React v17.x (2020 - 2021)</h3>
          The React 17 release is unusual because it doesn’t add any new developer-facing features. Instead, this release is primarily focused on making it easier to upgrade React itself.

          <h3>Introducing Zero-Bundle-Size React Server Components (2020)</h3>

        <!-- Slide 9 -->
        <section>
          <p>We are introducing a new kind of component—Server Components—that run ahead of time and are excluded from your JavaScript bundle. Server Components can run during the build, letting you read from the filesystem or fetch static content. They can also run on the server, letting you access your data layer without having to build an API. You can pass data by props from Server Components to the interactive Client Components in the browser.</p>
        </section>
        <!-- Slide 10 -->
        <section>
          <p> We generally recommend using an existing framework, but if you need to build your own custom framework, it is possible. Building your own RSC-compatible framework is not as easy as we’d like it to be, mainly due to the deep bundler integration needed. The current generation of bundlers are great for use on the client, but they weren’t designed with first-class support for splitting a single module graph between the server and the client. This is why we’re now partnering directly with bundler developers to get the primitives for RSC built-in.</p>

          <p>Next.js 12 (2021) - React Server Components (alpha)</p>
          <p>Next.js 13 (2022) - App directory support React Server Components</p>
          <p>Next.js 13.4 (2023) - Server actions (alpha)</p>
          <p>Next.js 14 (2023) - Server actions (stable)</p>

          <h3>React v18.x (2022 - 2024)</h3>
          <p>Concurrent React</p>
          <p>A key property of Concurrent React is that rendering is interruptible. When you first upgrade to React 18, before adding any concurrent features, updates are rendered the same as in previous versions of React — in a single, uninterrupted, synchronous transaction. With synchronous rendering, once an update starts rendering, nothing can interrupt it until the user can see the result on screen.</p>
        </section>
        <!-- Slide 13 -->
        <section>
          <p>In a concurrent render, this is not always the case. React may start rendering an update, pause in the middle, then continue later. It may even abandon an in-progress render altogether. React guarantees that the UI will appear consistent even if a render is interrupted. To do this, it waits to perform DOM mutations until the end, once the entire tree has been evaluated. With this capability, React can prepare new screens in the background without blocking the main thread. This means the UI can respond immediately to user input even if it’s in the middle of a large rendering task, creating a fluid user experience.</p>
        </section>
        <!-- Slide 14 -->
        <section>
          <p>Suspense for data fetching in opinionated frameworks like Relay, Next.js, Hydrogen, or Remix.</p>
        </section>
        <!-- Slide 15 -->
        <section>
          <p>useId is a new hook for generating unique IDs on both the client and server, while avoiding hydration mismatches. It is primarily useful for component libraries integrating with accessibility APIs that require unique IDs.</p>
        </section>
        <!-- Slide 16 -->
        <section>
          <p>startTransition and useTransition let you mark some state updates as not urgent. Other state updates are considered urgent by default. React will allow urgent state updates (for example, updating a text input) to interrupt non-urgent state updates (for example, rendering a list of search results).</p>
        </section>
        <!-- Slide 17 -->
        <section>
          <p>useDeferredValue lets you defer re-rendering a non-urgent part of the tree. It is similar to debouncing, but has a few advantages compared to it. There is no fixed time delay, so React will attempt the deferred render right after the first render is reflected on the screen. The deferred render is interruptible and doesn't block user input.</p>
        </section>
        <!-- Slide 18 -->
        <section>
          <p>Automatic Batching:
            Batching is when React groups multiple state updates into a single re-render for better performance. Without automatic batching, we only batched updates inside React event handlers. Updates inside of promises, setTimeout, native event handlers, or any other event were not batched in React by default. With automatic batching, these updates will be batched automatically.</p>
