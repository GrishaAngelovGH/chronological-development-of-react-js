# Chronological Development of ReactJS

Going through some of the major features for the different releases of ReactJS by my own opinion.

The journey begins with v0.14.x to the most recent release.

This is not intended to repeat the comprehensive changelog from 
https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md

It is an attempt to describe the development direction of ReactJS.
